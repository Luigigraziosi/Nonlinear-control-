This directory contains the curricular projects of the Nonlinear control and aerospace applications course. The Course is divided in two parts, the first based on Non-linear controller and the second bases on real applications on aircrafts and spacecraft.
The course focuses on the analysis and design of control algorithms for nonlinear systems, with applications in the aerospace sector. The main objective is to equip students with the skills to modify the behavior of complex real-world systems using advanced control techniques. In addition to traditional applications in aerospace and robotics, nonlinear control is also applied in emerging fields such as biomedicine and communication networks.
I gained knowledge of nonlinear system properties, feedback control, attitude kinematics and dynamics, and orbital dynamics. I learned to develop advanced control algorithms and implement simulation software in Matlab/Simulink, with a focus on orbit and attitude control problems for spacecraft.
